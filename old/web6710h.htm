    </h2>
    <p>
      Crucify means to execute someone by nailing them to a cross with metal
      spikes. Their hands are stretched out on the crossbeam with spikes driven
      through their wrists or hands. Their feet or ankles are attached to a
      cross with a metal spike. The weight of the victim's body tends to force
      the air out of his lungs. To raise up to breathe, the victim has to put
      weight on the wounds, and use a lot of strength. The victim is nailed to
      the cross while the cross is on the ground, then the cross is raised up
      and dropped into a hole, thus jarring the wounds. Before crucifiction, the
      victim was usually whipped with a Roman cat of nine tails, which had bits
      of glass and metal tied to its ends. This caused chunks of flesh to be
      removed and open wounds to be placed against the raw wood of the cross.
      The victim was made to carry the heavy crossbeam of his cross from the
      place of judgment to the place of crucifixion, but often was physically
      unable after the scourging, so another person would be pressed into
      involuntary service to carry the cross for him. Roman crucifixion was
      generally done totally naked to maximize both shame and discomfort.
      Eventually, the pain, weakness, dehydration, and exhaustion of the muscles
      needed to breathe make breathing impossible, and the victim suffocates.

    </h2>
    <p>
      "Soul" refers to the emotions and intellect of a living person, as well as
      that person's very life. It is distinguished in the Bible from a person's
      spirit and body. (1 Thessalonians 5:23, Hebrews 4:12)
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="span" id="span">span</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The length from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger when
      the hand is stretched out (about 9 inches or 22.8 cm.).
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="spirit" id="spirit">spirit</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spirit, breath, and wind all derive from the same Hebrew and Greek words.
      A person's spirit is the very essence of that person's life, which comes
      from God, who is a Spirit being (John 4:24, Genesis 1:2; 2:7). The Bible
      distinguishes between a person's spirit, soul, and body (1 Thessalonians
      5:23, Hebrews 4:12). Some beings may exist as spirits without necessarily
      having a visible body, such as angels and demons (Luke 9:39, 1 John
      4:1-3).

      <a name="teraphim" id="teraphim">teraphim</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Teraphim are household idols that may have been associated with
      inheritance rights to the household property.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="Yah" id="Yah">Yah</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Yah" is a shortened form of "Yahweh," which is God's proper name. This
      form is used occasionally in the Old Testament, mostly in the Psalms. See
      "Yahweh."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="Yahweh" id="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Yahweh" is God's proper name. In Hebrew, the four consonants roughly
      equivalent to YHWH were considered too holy to pronounce, so the Hebrew
      word for "Lord" (Adonai) was substituted when reading it aloud. When vowel
      points were added to the Hebrew Old Testament, the vowel points for
      "Adonai" were mixed with the consonants for "Yahweh," which if you
      pronounced it literally as written, would be pronounced "Yehovah" or
      "Jehovah." When the Old Testament was translated to Greek, the tradition
      of substituting "Lord" for God's proper name continued in the translation
      of God's name to "Lord" (Kurios). Some English Bibles translate God's
      proper name to "LORD" or "GOD" (usually with small capital letters), based
      on that same tradition. This can get really confusing, since two other
      words ("Adonai" and "Elohim") translate to "Lord" and "God," and they are
      sometimes used together. The ASV of 1901 (and some other translations)
      render YHWH as "Jehovah." The most probable pronunciation of God's proper
      name is "Yahweh." In Hebrew, the name "Yahweh" is related to the active
      declaration "I AM." See Exodus 3:13-14. Since Hebrew has no tenses, the
      declaration "I AM" also implies "I WAS" and "I WILL BE." Compare
      Revelation 1:8.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
